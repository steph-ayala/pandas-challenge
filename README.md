# pandas-challenge

This challenge was difficult for me. There were a lot of dataframes to be created wihtin the datset. This showed me that working with data is not a one stop shop. There are many ways to manipulate the dat in order to get the analysis you require to solve a problem. 

There were many correlations that you can see once all datframes were made.

There were many calcualations that had to be done to see the scores in a different and more educating way.

I used functions such as .nunique(), .mean(), .unique().


For this challenge I used Expert, Google and attened office hours.
